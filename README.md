# Project Description
The files in this repository were used for the analysis of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using paired-end sequencing data on the QIIME2 platform.

# Project Details 
The original files for this project were downloaded from [github user spacocha's PreheimLab_16S_SOPs repository](https://github.com/spacocha/PreheimLab_16S_SOPs) and modified. The modified files are uploaded to this repository. 

This work was carried out at the Advanced Research Computing at Hopkins (ARCH) core facility [Rockfish](https://www.arch.jhu.edu/policies/rockfish-citizen/), which is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant number OAC1920104, using [QIIME2](https://qiime2.org/) version 2023.5.
